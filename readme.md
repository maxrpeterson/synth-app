# General Assembly - WDI Melville - Final Project

I have always had an interest in music production, and thought it would be cool to try and make something for it on the web. My project would be a little bit of a sandbox, in that you can create your own synth patches. It would also be great to have a way to save patches you make using some sort of database. Some reach goals would be a sequencer for notes, and sharing patches among friends.
